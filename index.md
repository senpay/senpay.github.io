## About

Test Club (founded by Alexander Pushkarev) is a Test and Test Automation focused community with the goal of providing independent secondary (and, potentially - primary) research and sharing a verifiable, reliable knowledge.

Here we aim to:
  * Publish know-how - certain things and approaches that did work in a specific context, with the indication to an area of applicability;
  * Summary of the scientific researches proving or disproving specific points of view regarding certain open questions in Testing and Test Automation.

  More information about Test Club is coming soon.
